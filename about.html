                <h1>Information about our Web site:</h1>
                <p>Our website project aims to serve as a platform to showcase the work that we have done as a team, share our experience and knowledge gained through various coding events, and to promote interest in the field of coding and technology. Through our website, we hope to provide valuable information regarding our team, including information about each of our team members, their backgrounds, and achievements. Additionally, our website will serve as a platform to document our experience participating in the Hour of Code event, organized by Code.org, and highlight the lessons learned during the event. Our website project will also showcase our coding skills, as we aim to design and develop a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing website that is accessible to all. We believe that our website will be an excellent resource for anyone interested in the field of coding, web development, and technology.</p>
                <p>During the development of our website, we encountered several challenges related to CSS margins and Java programming. One of the common issues was with the margins, where we had to adjust the margins of various elements to align them properly and ensure consistency throughout the website. Additionally, we faced some difficulties in understanding Java programming concepts and implementing them effectively. Our team had to put in extra effort to understand the logic and syntax of Java and integrate it with the website seamlessly. Despite these challenges, our team was able to overcome them by utilizing online resources, seeking guidance from experts, and collaborating effectively to create a professional-looking website that met our client's expectations. </p>
